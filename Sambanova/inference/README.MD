# Inference using the SambaNova Cloud

[SambaNova Cloud](https://cloud.sambanova.ai/) is available for developers to easily use the best open source models at record-breaking inference speeds. These models are powered by our state-of-the-art AI chip, the SN40L. 

## Quick Start Guide

Get started using the SambaNova Cloud API in just a few minutes!

### Get your API key

1. Create an account on the [SambaNova Cloud Developer Portal](https://cloud.sambanova.ai/) to get an API key.
2. Once logged in, navigate to the [API Keys section](https://cloud.sambanova.ai/apis) of the portal and generate a new key. 
3. Save the API key securely. For example, you can set it as an environment variable:
   ```shell
   export SAMBANOVA_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

### Pick a model

The SambaNova Cloud is frequently updated with latest open source models, running at the fastest tokens per second.

To make an inference request from a model, youâ€™ll need the modelâ€™s corresponding model-id. The full list of models and corresponding model-idâ€™s are [listed here](https://docs.sambanova.ai/cloud/docs/get-started/supported-models).

### Make an API request

You can make an inference request to our models in Python using several approaches, two of which are described below:
1. Open AI client library 
2. LangChain connectors

#### OpenAI client library

Install the OpenAI Python library, as shown below. Make sure you have Python3 and pip installed:
```shell  
pip install openai
```

Next, copy the code below into a python file called, `hello_world.py`.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.sambanova.ai/v1", 
    api_key="your-api-key-here"
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct",
  messages = [
      {"role": "system", "content": "Answer the question in a couple sentences."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Share a happy story with me"}
    ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

Once copied into the file, replace the string field in "your-api-key-here" with your API Key value. Then run the file with the command below:
```shell  
python hello_word.py
```

#### LangChain connectors
See [here](https://docs.sambanova.ai/cloud/docs/integrations/langchain) to learn how to use LangChain with SambaNova models.

## Tool Use Examples

Below are two examples you can try. **We recommend using Python >= 3.10 and < 3.12**. 

### Example 1: Getting Started with Tool Use

Run the [tool_use_get_started.ipynb](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/AIaccelerators-ISC25-tutorial/blob/main/Sambanova/inference/tool_use_get_started.ipynb) notebook. 

### Example 2: Complete Function Calling App

This function calling kit is an example of tools calling implementation and a generic function calling module that can be used inside your application workflows.
